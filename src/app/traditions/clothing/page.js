            Iraqi traditional clothing reflects the country's diverse cultural heritage, religious influences, and adaptation to the local climate. Different regions, ethnic groups, and religious communities have developed distinct styles that have evolved over centuries.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Traditional garments in Iraq are more than just clothingâ€”they represent cultural identity, religious values, social status, and practical adaptations to the environment.

            From the flowing dishdasha and abaya to the colorful Kurdish costumes, Iraqi traditional clothing showcases remarkable craftsmanship, including intricate embroidery, metalwork, and textile production techniques passed down through generations.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Traditional Iraqi attire is often complemented by distinctive accessories and jewelry that enhance both the aesthetic appeal and cultural significance of the clothing.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Headwear is particularly important, with various styles of keffiyeh (headdress) for men and intricate scarves or veils for women. These head coverings serve practical purposes in the hot, dry climate while also indicating regional identity and sometimes social status.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Jewelry plays a significant role in traditional Iraqi dress, especially for women. Silver and gold pieces often feature intricate designs inspired by ancient Mesopotamian motifs, Islamic geometric patterns, or natural elements. These pieces not only beautify but also serve as portable wealth and symbols of family heritage.
